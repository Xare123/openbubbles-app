# Cloud Sync V2 current connection treemap

This document is the short operational source of truth. It contains current
architecture, safety rules, qualification state, and the next falsification
test. Dated investigations, obsolete candidates, run-by-run notes, patents,
and historical evidence remain intact in the
[investigation log](cloud_sync_v2/history/CLOUD_SYNC_V2_INVESTIGATION_LOG_THROUGH_2026-09-07.md).
The [bundle index](cloud_sync_v2/index.md) points to both documents and the
current evidence set.

## Decision

Treat Messages in iCloud as a durable replicated log. Remote ingestion and
local projection are separate progress clocks. A successful fetch is not a
successful sync. Undecryptable or temporarily unprojectable records remain
durable repair work and never disappear merely because a later token exists.

Every protected operation must remain bound to one exact tuple:

```text
account fingerprint
  + live CloudMessagesClient identity
  + read-authentication generation
  + protected-store identity
  + native writer-pause permit
  + container/database/zone
  + checkpoint generation
```

If any member changes, fail closed and retain the evidence. Never borrow a
different identity or container, create PCS state from the read path, fall
back to legacy sync, clear a cursor, or continue under a replacement account.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `LIVE-PROVEN` | A content-free trace exercised the exact boundary on the named platform. Proof does not transfer between platforms. |
| `TEST-PROVEN` | Source-contract or behavioral tests cover the boundary; current-device proof remains. |
| `SOURCE-IMPLEMENTED` | The repair is in the candidate, but full exact-source qualification is incomplete. |
| `IN REPAIR` | A concrete counterexample invalidated the previous candidate. |
| `GAP` | A safe end-to-end behavior is not implemented or needs a product decision. |

## Current candidate

| Item | Current evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Fully qualified APK | Source `6f778c99eda74f0c1e98eeca205c85afefba6054`; [GCE 34741584069](https://github.com/Xare123/openbubbles-app/actions/runs/34741584069) passed all selected tests, bridge validation, packaging, native-library verification, signing and cleanup. Includes pacing and live-proven precision recovery. Signed artifact ID 10312788076, archive digest `fa37e83bd68c3e5e4da4352aa703b9788ca93a719c58aadc0feca7abee5e7028`. Not installed. |
| Last observed Pixel | Canary 883f001868ac64a160c20018b2fb46e3aedb029e, version 1.15.0 (20002227). Fresh-account messages visibly restored. At 2026-09-13 04:01:18Z, Messages still fetched; Chats/Attachments had terminal empty reads. Outbox stayed 0 -> 0. Later ADB inventories were empty; recheck before device actions. |
| Qualified source / next candidate | Native `008a342c566304c907249dae25721ca943164fe4` is Windows-qualified. Current Dart chained-write code is separately unit/live-tested. Multipart numeric reply parsing is the next unqualified native change. Pixel integration remains separate. |
| Recent-first | Local recent-chat visibility implemented/tested. Account-wide newest-history fetching is NOT implemented. Persist a fresh-stream direction before its first request and bind continuation/restart before enabling legacy-style order. Existing cursors keep their direction. |
| Windows writes | Parent-31, edits-32/33 and unsend-34 passed a direct single-part chain: native receipts and one exact CloudKit confirmation per mutation. Fresh read proved all three history entries/text/milliseconds and one retracted part. Completed-unsend restart submitted zero updates. Evidence: private `windows-chain-20260913/qualification.json` and `windows-chain-echo-20260913/exact-chain-proof.json` under build-evidence. First attempt hit IDS 6005 before claim/send; explicit same-identity refresh worked. Pixel, groups, independent UI and persistent registration health remain open. |
| Release state | Full production is not established. Remaining gates below apply. |
| Logging repair | Logger lifetime and explicit Find My target are qualified in native 3496034e3. Awaiting `doFirstTimeInit` in the Windows hosts fixes startup ordering. Native Find My init/refresh diagnostics now show absent `locations`, not a coordinate-join failure. |
| Current native qualification | Run 34770635736 passed source `008a342c566304c907249dae25721ca943164fe4`, pilot `a8db46f655`, in 25m56s: 145 selected Rust tests, 519 focused Dart tests, 51 packaged-DLL codec cases. Parent verified 39 source inputs, 12 logs, three ARM64 PEs and signed DLL `f6606a65ec755747ccbaea7ec6eb82523ddf2aaa4fdb5bb6b61b5d5b063b6278`; another 51 codec cases and its actual loaded path passed under App Control. New Dart chain code passed 115 local tests and live checks separately. |
| Next integration | Live rejected replies have three canonical numeric part components plus one final UUID. Candidate preserves that complete path and exact parent, retaining ambiguous forms. Await native tests and live replay. Extension failures identify LiveLayout/Malformed and BinaryPreflight/LimitExceeded; candidate adds wrapper-type/byte-count evidence without relaxing bounds. |
| Active qualification / resume | Windows run 34772982148, job 103765852345, source `e5547e8c7e9f1b4a4b243c408be84d099194867b`, pilot `a3724ebd0c8983a6de043aa35e6e4bccc5fc4aa3`. Exact-source validation passed. On success verify artifact/source/log hashes, sign separately, run actual DLL codec tests, then perform retained inspection and a bounded replay. Do not restart a live job after observation timeout. All current agents/local app/test processes are closed; C: 76.15 GiB free. The active Windows request is completed unsend-34, not a pending send. |
| Fast Windows loop | Current Dart plus the verified native DLL opens the retained projection in 8.65 seconds. The stale Windows relay ticket was updated to the Pixel's working ticket after proving the same physical relay and preserving Windows installation IDs/keys. A real read then completed in about 31 seconds and exposed a quarantined own-edit echo. |
| Current merge repair | Real native-source/copy qualification passed the bounded production recovery and normal applier, preserving local history. Live Windows report `obcs2-semantic-1789278811033254.json` applied two pending messages; fresh-process repeat `1789278895014946` fetched/applied zero, with no conflict. Both observed empty terminal reads in all zones and kept outbox 15 -> 15 with remote writes disabled. Full native-crate qualification remains. |
| Current read result | Report `obcs2-semantic-1789321273552358.json` fetched/applied one echo after the chain, outbox 21 -> 21, remote writes disabled, retained 6648. Chats/Attachments observed empty terminal reads; Messages did not on this pass. Exact text/history/retraction matched. Evidence/rollback: private `build-evidence/windows-chain-echo-20260913`. Not a full-history or terminal-ingestion claim. |
| Actual extension boundary | The 37-record inspection kept durable state unchanged. Five type-2 records now pass association classification but fail extension metadata decoding; two records have type 3. None of this seven-record sample is proved restored. Eight sampled attachment dependencies have no local parent, six otherwise materializable. The sample does not prove frequency or which parent failures caused attachment debt. |
| Retained diagnosis | A non-projecting Windows sample inspected 37 current-generation retained saves with unchanged checkpoints, outbox and sampled rows. Seven sampled Message dependencies are unsupported extension payloads; all eight sampled Attachment dependencies lack a local parent, six otherwise materializable. This deliberate sample does not establish prevalence or parent causality. Native fixed-field diagnostics are prepared for the next Windows DLL; no parser admission was loosened. |

Prior tables and obsolete next steps were preserved verbatim in the September 12
consolidation entry of the [investigation log](cloud_sync_v2/history/CLOUD_SYNC_V2_INVESTIGATION_LOG_FROM_2026-09-07.md).
Historical tests do not establish current-device behavior.

## Scope and current evidence

| Capability | Established | Remaining |
| --- | --- | --- |
| History read | Fresh Canary visibly restores chats/messages. | Terminal ingestion, actionable retained repair or explained unavailability, repeat/incremental/restart proof. |
| Media/documents/reactions read | Earlier representative live results; current materialization/filtering implemented. | Current Pixel photos, video, transcript GIFs, documents and incremental updates. GIFs need not appear in profile media. |
| Direct writes | Bounded Windows text, reaction, image, edit and unsend protocol results. | Ordinary Pixel composition, restart recovery and independent client display. |
| Groups | Restored-group binding implemented/tested. | Approved two-recipient text, attachments, reactions and supported mutations. No personal group substitution. |
| Edits/deletes | Direct single-part Windows send/edit/edit/unsend, exact echoed history/retraction and completed restart. | Pixel, groups, conflicts, independent display, supported tombstones and mid-flight recovery. |
| Lifecycle | Identity/reset fences and bounded Android worker implemented/tested. | Current background/lock, reconnect, process death, token expiry and account repair. |
| Progress/speed | Card and smaller Regular workload implemented. | Integrated qualification, Pixel UX and measured performance. |
| Newest history first | Local recent-chat admission fixed. | Durable fresh-stream direction plus multi-page/restart/incremental qualification. |
| FaceTime | Lifecycle/layout candidate; offline leave analysis repaired. | Actual two-way media beyond 30 seconds, remote hangup, subsequent and incoming calls. |
| Find My | [Windows service test](FINDMY_ASTRA_20260910.md) reaches the real account and user-confirmed sole shared person. Fresh roster and selected reads return that entry without coordinates. | Native response/secure-location handling, independent UI refresh, Devices/Items inventory and supported per-device actions. No stopped-sharing inference or Items success claim. |
| SMS/MMS/RCS | Excluded by user. | Preserve and label exclusion separately from iMessage failures. |

## Safety gates

These gates are non-negotiable:

1. Bind account, live client, credential generation, protected store, zone,
   checkpoint generation, and writer-pause capability at every external wait.
2. Journal each protected page and pending token atomically before committing
   the native page lease.
3. Project in dependency order: chats, messages, reactions, attachments.
4. Promote a token only across a complete contiguous terminal journal.
5. Keep fetched, retained, and exactly projected progress separate.
6. Keep live IDS/APNs receive readiness independent from archive repair.
7. Admit a write only from an exact durable row and a fresh protected
   dependency binding.
8. Prove exact remote absence before first create. Persist the ambiguity fence
   before consuming a prepared mutation.
9. After submission uncertainty, reconcile by exact readback only. Never
   automatically replay, update-merge, quarantine away ambiguity, or delete.
10. Require an exact protected receipt before committing a record map and
    terminal outbox state together.
11. Preserve Alpha, its hardware identity, its database, and its messages.
12. Keep Windows Smart App Control enabled. Use GCE or a trusted signed
    environment when local policy blocks an executable.

## Explicitly forbidden fallbacks

- Use of a general or write-capable container when semantic read authentication
  is cold.
- Cross-account, cross-client, cross-generation, cross-zone, or cross-store
  authentication and decryption.
- `ZoneSaveOperation`, PCS creation, clique reset, or remote mutation from the
  semantic read path.
- Silent fallback to legacy CloudKit sync.
- Cursor clearing for an unknown, malformed, or inconvenient error.
- Treating `retainedUnprojected` as successful local projection.
- Advancing past an incomplete journal.
- Deleting local rows for read-path tombstones.
- Letting optional CloudKit work delay live message startup or acknowledgment.
- Using GCE as a live Apple client or exporting account, relay, PCS, or device
  identity to CI.

## Read state machine

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Explicit Canary or private Windows run] --> B[Admission and interlock]
  B --> C[Bind account, client, generation, store, and writer pause]
  C --> D[Warm exact Messages, Keychain, Security, and three PCS zones]
  D --> E[Fetch bounded protected page under the same capability]
  E --> F[Protect page and atomically journal rows plus pending token]
  F --> G[Commit protected page lease]
  G --> H[Decode under the same capability and exact cached PCS config]
  H --> I[Validate presence, identity, route, and canonical semantics]
  I --> J[Project chats, messages, reactions, and attachments in order]
  J --> K[Persist applied, retained, retryable, or quarantined state]
  K --> L[Promote only a complete terminal contiguous journal]
  L --> M[Revalidate identity, quiesce, report, and resume writers]
  H -. dependency or parser unavailable .-> R[Retain protected evidence]
  R --> H
  E -. token expired .-> X[Stop for generation-scoped rebootstrap]
```

The durable journal between fetch and projection is the critical cut. It makes
projection repair possible without refetching or losing the exact server
evidence.

## Outbound create state machine

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Read and ownership gates pass] --> B[Select one exact durable outgoing row]
  B --> C[Bind content, route, members, generation, record, ETag, and snapshot]
  C --> D[Acquire v2ReadWrite interlock and revalidate after every await]
  D --> E[Derive deterministic record and operation identity]
  E --> F[Exact protected remote lookup]
  F -- same digest exists --> G[Confirm local no-op; zero saves]
  F -- exact NotFound --> H[Prepare create-only submission]
  F -- divergent --> I[Stop with conflict before submission]
  F -- unresolved --> J[Remain pending; zero saves]
  H --> K[Persist exact capability and ambiguity fence]
  K --> L[Consume once]
  L -- confirmed --> M[Commit exact receipt, map, and outbox terminal state]
  L -- timeout or uncertainty --> N[Mark mutationUnknown and preserve UUIDs]
  N --> O[Guard-owned exact readback; never submit]
  O -- committed --> M
  O -- proven not applied --> P[Return to pending after proof]
  O -- unresolved or divergent --> N
```

Direct, reaction, and group operations use distinct protected binding tags.
One lane cannot be cast into another. Confirmed replay is readback-only and
must prove zero saves.

### Attachment-write integration boundary

The next vertical slice must connect the existing composer journal to this
entire chain, not merely add an upload validator:

```text
exact attachment descriptor actually sent through IDS
  -> protected descriptor + metadata + one retained record identity
  -> verified original MMCS bytes, exact pinned length
  -> existing account/container + attachment-zone PCS + boundary-key lookup
  -> byte upload, retaining its receipt or unresolved-upload state
  -> create-only CloudAttachment(cm metadata, lqa asset)
  -> exact record readback and confirmed dependency
  -> parent Message with the same attachment references
```

- The Dart store atomically admits completed Attachment-v1 uploads, and the
  runtime byte-upload coordinator and parent-message connection are implemented.
  Live byte upload has succeeded; child/parent record readback remains open.
  Native integration separates protected pre-upload preparation
  (`outboundAttachmentUpload`) from completed record-create material
  (`outboundAttachment`). Neither grants network permission or parent admission.
- Existing `Attachment.metadata["rustpush"]` stores an MMCS descriptor with
  decryption material at upload-finish, before IDS send success. It is mutable,
  not an encrypted receipt or proof of what IDS sent. Pin the actual wire
  descriptor into protected admission before send, then bind native success to
  it. The v3 receipt now carries the protected source binding, not raw keys or
  descriptors. Composer source staging/adoption is connected; whole-runtime
  attachment qualification remains separate.
- Do not put the source only inside the IDS receipt: acknowledgment deletes
  that file immediately after durable confirmation, before outbound admission.
  A protected source needs its own durable reference and recovery/GC ownership
  through parent adoption. The additive journal `protectedSourceBinding` field
  now owns that reference independently; old rows remain null and unqualified.
- Re-fetching that pinned MMCS object avoids a second permanent plaintext-byte
  journal and mutable-file reuse. It needs APS/MMCS availability, complete
  target/chunk validation, and the pinned plaintext length. A missing or expired
  object must defer, not substitute a different local file. Chunk integrity and
  length do not validate a guessed CTR key; the key must be the one actually sent.
- Reuse `CloudMessagesPreparedSaveSubmission` for record-save correlation and
  single consumption; the next native candidate supplies typed preparation
  and checked readback without enabling admission. Do not use
  legacy `save_attachments`, which enters generic update-capable saving.
- Legacy `prepare_file` calls `get_boundary_key`, which can create a keychain
  item. V2 lookup must also use keystore `get_secret`, not `ensure_secret`, when
  unwrapping existing boundary material. Keep the DSID and entry under the same
  state lock; a missing key fails without generating either local or remote keys.
- The attachment-specific local-send path extends outbox admission and parent
  encoding together. The plaintext-only path still rejects media.
- Record identity must be persisted before first upload and reused on retry.
  Legacy allocates a random attachment record ID; do not assume the proven
  Message GUID HMAC naming rule also applies to attachment records.
- `prepare_put_v2` randomizes chunk keys, FORD key and IV. Re-preparing identical
  plaintext retains neither the original encrypted descriptor nor its reference.
  Preserve the entire `PreparedPut`, including each chunk's key/signature/length,
  under platform protection before upload. Bind it to the original parent source,
  attachment metadata, full container-issued record identifier and file digest.
  A returned asset must match that exact preparation before record-create staging.
- Upload uncertainty and record-save uncertainty are distinct. Record NotFound
  cannot authorize blind byte re-upload or record-ID replacement.
- Next integration order: protected actual-IDS descriptor ownership in the
  local-send journal; durable pre-upload plan and attempt state; exact completed
  upload adoption; existing create-only record transport/readback; parent message
  dependency and encoding. Do not bypass the missing journal ownership by calling
  the legacy uploader or treating native codec tests as end-to-end qualification.
- Native send preparation is a separate boundary: `IMClient.send` calls
  `MessageInst.prepare_send`, which assigns a new send timestamp and may add
  the sender/conversation GUID. Capturing a Dart-built MessageInst and then
  allowing preparation to mutate it is not proof of the final wire. Integration
  must validate the final attachment descriptors and bind positive IDS success
  to the original source. Prefer an explicit validator for the three known
  preparation changes (timestamp, generated conversation GUID, added self
  participant), with all body/recipient/attachment fields unchanged, if that
  avoids a new two-phase send API. Freezing the prepared submission is an
  alternative, not a prerequisite. Do not ignore arbitrary changed fields.
- Local reflection is another normal transformation: `indexedPartsToAttributedBodyDyn`
  changes attachment GUIDs to `<messageGuid>_<part>` and inserts a space where
  the composer may use an object placeholder. Source identity must bind ordered
  descriptors and actual text/formatting, not these local aliases. Resolve each
  body reference to its exact attachment; do not accept count-only matching,
  unrelated rows, substituted descriptors or changed text. The native protected
  source still pins the actual sent descriptor, independently of local UI IDs.

## Fast qualification loop

Use the cheapest boundary that can falsify the current hypothesis:

```text
source contract or behavioral logic
  -> focused local test when policy allows, otherwise GCE
  -> full exact-source GCE suite and APK build

Apple protocol, PCS, save, readback, or replay behavior
  -> exact-source trusted minimal Windows harness when available
  -> otherwise signed Canary on Pixel

Android registration, ObjectBox/UI, background, lock, or lifecycle behavior
  -> signed Canary on Pixel

cross-device convergence
  -> independent Apple device confirmation
```

Do not rebuild a Canary for every code edit. GCE handles exact-source Dart,
Rust, bridge-generation, identity, projection, and reconciliation tests.
Windows ARM64 bundles are built on the isolated GitHub runner and imported
only after archive, native-codec, source/configuration and launch verification.
The retained `6abbeede2` runtime proves its bounded direct write, not newer
attachment code; `3ebcc81c9` must pass import and its own live test.
Local Cargo compilation remains blocked by App Control 4551. Keep that policy
enabled. The verified cloud bundle runs with the existing engineering signing
path when the original ObjectBox vendor DLL is preserved; re-signing that
vendor DLL caused the earlier startup block. Credentials and PCS state remain
local, never on GCE. Windows qualifies protocol boundaries, not Pixel lifecycle
or final Android release behavior.

Use five promotion lanes and do not skip upward:

1. **Focused local lane:** handwritten Dart contracts and structural guards for
   the changed boundary. It may reject a patch but cannot qualify native Rust.
2. **Fast GCE lane:** `app-rust-only` regenerates and verifies FRB bindings,
   checks the Rust bridge, and runs the app Rust library without Android SDK,
   Gradle, signing, or APK work.
3. **Full GCE lane:** only a promotion candidate runs every Dart/Rust/rustpush/
   protector test and produces the signed, ABI-verified Canary APK.
4. **Windows protocol lane:** exact-source minimal harnesses may falsify Apple
   request, PCS, save, readback, and replay behavior without an APK. They do not
   qualify Android lifecycle or UI behavior.
5. **Pixel release lane:** batch direct send, process-death recovery, group send,
   readback, restart, lifecycle, and UI evidence into as few signed-APK sessions
   as safety permits. Manual Apple-device display remains independent evidence.

The manual-writer Pixel lane now has a host-controlled three-phase gate:
[`pixel_cloudkit_write_gate.ps1`](../tooling/pixel_cloudkit_write_gate.ps1)
and [`vm_trigger_cloudkit_write.dart`](../tooling/vm_trigger_cloudkit_write.dart).
`prepare` establishes V2 ownership locally and returns only a candidate GUID
hash; `run` restarts Canary, reselects that exact hash, and invokes the existing
one-intent production path; optional `verify` restarts again and requires zero
new admissions. Every phase pins the app source and host-tool hashes, takes the
recipient only from a process environment variable bound to a separately
supplied SHA-256, emits content-free evidence, and requires the automatic
worker to be absent. The tooling is test-proven but does not replace live
CloudKit readback or independent Apple-device display.

## Recovery policy

| Failure | Safe response |
| --- | --- |
| Read credential cold or revoked | Warm the in-memory same-account credential, restore the encrypted same-account credential, or perform one bounded refresh. Then require user action. |
| Account or client changes | Stop before projection or acknowledgment and preserve journal, source, and checkpoint. |
| PCS key unavailable | Warm or look up only the exact same-scope zone. Retain the protected record if still unavailable. |
| Network or throttling | Preserve token and evidence, honor bounded retry-after, and retry later. |
| Missing parent or parser | Retain protected evidence and retry projection after the dependency or parser repair. |
| Malformed record | Store a fixed content-free reason and explicit repairability classification. Never guess identity. |
| Process death after fetch | Recover the protected lease, replay the durable journal, and keep the prior token until terminal. |
| Token expired | Stop, require the account-bound protected reset proof, release the read boundary, reacquire the destructive-reset interlock and native pause, advance the exact zone generation once, fence old evidence, reconcile authority after interruption, and replay at most once. |
| Write result unknown | Preserve request and operation UUIDs, protected receipt, and fence. Exact readback is the only next network action. |

## Current critical path

1. Finish the exact multipart-reply qualification named in the candidate table.
   Verify/sign its DLL, run actual codec tests, then inspect and replay retained
   records. Preserve the full numeric reply-part path and scoped parent identity.
2. Resolve the measured extension failures at LiveLayout and BinaryPreflight.
   Use type/size evidence before changing decoding or limits. Do not discard
   protected records or treat a diagnostic label as corrupted user data.
3. Verify repeat/cold-restart reads, terminal stream state, duplicate suppression,
   legible text, and representative current media/documents. Separate excluded
   telephony and tombstones from actionable iMessage projection work.
4. On the Pixel, qualify the installed candidate and ordinary composer, background/
   lock/reconnect, registration repair, and independent-client display. Preserve
   Alpha; do not infer completion from Windows tests.
5. Finish approved group/media/mutation and mid-flight recovery cases. The direct
   single-part Windows chain is proved, not the full cross-device matrix.
6. Qualify fresh-stream newest-first ordering without reversing existing cursors.
   FaceTime and Find My retain their separate live gates listed above.

## Current ownership and continuation rules

- Parent owns account operations and integration. Completed agents have been
  reviewed/closed. Exact active agent/job handles belong in the candidate table.
- Preserve the qualified DLLs, source manifests and rollback evidence. Current
  generated bindings already include extensionMetadataJson; a metadata JSON
  schema change inside that string is not a new FRB ABI by itself.
- Version-2 extension context separates wire session identity from the archive
  UUID. Base/predecessor ownership, chat/provider and timestamps are validated.
  Late-content repair is atomic and paged; attachment owners are never moved.
- Do not rebuild or install an APK for Dart-only Windows qualification. An actual
  native/ABI change needs its matching cloud-built, separately verified runtime.
- Follow AGENTS.md before compaction: reconcile docs, review agents and preserve
  exact resume handles. Do not restart a job solely after a polling timeout.

## Existing-history adoption evidence gate

Automatic adoption is not safe from the offline checkout alone. For each
queued intent, a content-free live observation must first distinguish the six
`existing_history` categories and prove exactly one current direct-iMessage Chat
owner under the same account, protected store, scope, generation, writer epoch,
and native session. The proof must bind the canonical Chat lookup hash, semantic
snapshot, service-identifier alias, canonical/member record map, latest applied
non-tombstone save, ETag, protected record reference, and payload digest. A
later retained save, tombstone, competing owner, or native `overlaps` /
`incomplete` result remains a defer.

Only after that proof may the production local-send admission seam atomically
re-read the state-1 journal intent and unchanged provisional Message/Chat,
adopt the exact existing relationship, and persist its durable reconciliation
binding under the existing `v2ReadWrite` interlock and auth fence. That
transaction must create no Chat stage, outbox row, record-map mutation, remote
save, merge-update, or delete. Restart must repeat as a no-op; any mismatch must
roll back and leave the intent ready/deferred. A bare Message reparent is not a
fallback because the journal source digest binds the original Chat row and UUID.

## Edit and unsend invariants

- Message history/retractions live in the existing message's summary fields
  (`ec`, `ep`, `otr`, `rp`). Revision indexes are payload-local, not global clocks.
  Displayed body and history must remain one compatible snapshot.
- Retractions are monotonic for the exact owned message. Older history cannot
  overwrite newer text or resurrect an unsent message. Unknown parts and
  incompatible histories remain retained; never flatten unsupported bodies.
- Patch retained summary/plist/protobuf values and preserve unknown fields.
  Do not rebuild an existing record with the lossy legacy Message.toCloud path.
  Native message patching changes only the intended field spans.
- Conditional updates bind the exact predecessor record and ETag. Persist the
  mutation intent, prepared time/source, positive IDS receipt, reflection and
  request identity before submission. Unknown outcomes reconcile by readback;
  they do not authorize a retry, recreation, or overwrite.
- A completed edit can provide read-only predecessor evidence for a later mutation
  only when its exact reflected history and confirmed operation/map still match.
  The previous source remains terminal. New mutations have distinct identities.
- Current direct Windows chain/readback/restart proof is in the candidate table.
  It does not establish independent recipient rendering, group behavior, ordinary
  Pixel capture, or all interruption points.

The superseded implementation chronology, wire-experiment details and older
qualification commands are preserved verbatim in the
[historical treemap tail](cloud_sync_v2/history/TREEMAP_PRE_MULTIPART_2026-09-13.md).
